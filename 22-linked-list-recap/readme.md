# Linked List
- data structure for storing a collection of items/elements, often compared to arrays.
- data is stored on a sequence of nodes linked to each other
- every element in a linked list is a node. Every node has two parts
- each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node/element
- the pointer indicates the address of the next node(where the next node is)
- the first element/node is called the head(root node)
- the last element/node is called the tail. The tail has no reference to the next node
- in a singly linked list, navigation is foward only
- in a doubly linked list, navigation is in foward and boackward
- it is faster to traverse an array than a linked list
- to traverse a linked list, you need to traverse the list starting from the head
- adding a node at the begining of the linked list takes constant time O(1)
- adding something at the begining using arrays as abit more complicated. 
- all the values will have to shift
