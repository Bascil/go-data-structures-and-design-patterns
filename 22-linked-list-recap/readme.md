# Linked List
- data structure for storing a collection of items/elements
- often compared to arrays.
- data is stored on a sequence of nodes linked to each other
- each node contains data and a pointer to the next node
- the pointer indicates the address of the next node(where the next node is)
- it is faster to traverse an array than a linked list
- to traverse a linked list, you fist need to go to the linked list and follow along
- adding a node at the beginign of the linked list takes constant time O(1)
- adding something at the begining using arrays as abit more complicated. 
- all the values will have to shift
